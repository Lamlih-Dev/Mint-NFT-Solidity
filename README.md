# Mint An NFT Programmatically Using Solidity
This is my fist time creating a smart contract to mint an NFT ! I had so much fun and learned and tried so much things such :
<ul>
  <li>How to write, build and ship an NFT in local environment, testnet environment and mainnet.</li>
  <li>How to check your NFT contract on Etherscan, Polygonscan and other platforms.</li>
  <li>How to create NFT with JSON metadata.</li>
  <li>How to connect with alchemy network.</li>
  <li>How to deploy a smart contract using Hardhat.</li>
<ul>
